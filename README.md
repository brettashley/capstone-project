# ML MIX LAB

#### Spend less time searching for music and more time creating. 

## tl;dr
Creating great mixes is an art, and musicians have been using sampling to improve their songs for years. Finding songs that mix well together can be difficult and time consuming, and can yield unsatisfying results. Using one seed song, DJ's can use ML Mix Lab to find a list of songs that they can use together in a mix. I have used collaborative filtering to determine what makes songs mix well together, according to a database of production level mixing and sampling. Technologies used include Python, PostgreSQL, PySpark, Selenium, AWS, and Psycopg2.
